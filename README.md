# custom-c-lib
Custom C functions library, intended to replace standard C library functions on unix systems, not something really useful but I had to do it during my studies.
Also contains some other more helpful functions.

*I put this here for educational purposes only do NOT use it for production*

## Do they work though? ##
Sure they do !
I used them for many years in my projects for school, but as mentioned above you would not want to use them in production.
